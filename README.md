# Multi-Robot Exploration and Map Merging

## Description
The goal is to use multiple robots to autonomously explore an environment and create one global merged map comprised of each's robot individual map. This can be achived with or without knwoledge of the robot's initial positions. 

Frontier Exploration was implemented as the autonomous navigation algorithm. Map merging was achieved by modifying the [multirobot_map_merge](http://wiki.ros.org/multirobot_map_merge) node.
